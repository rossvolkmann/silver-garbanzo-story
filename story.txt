While I make the long drive to Epic on Wednesdays, I think to myself...

What a wonderful world. I see skies of blue and clouds of white. 

Uh-oh, better keep my eyes on the road!

But it was too late, the car flew off the road and into a ditch. 

But everything was fine?  What a dramatic but ultimately inconsequential morning for me.
